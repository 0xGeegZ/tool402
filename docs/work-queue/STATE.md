- LAST_QUEUE_VALIDATION: M04-T060 is accepted. M04-T070 has a committed inbox card, local specification and plan, accepted dependencies and integration evidence, proposed disjoint two-path ownership, and no local human blocker; it has not yet passed design review or ready-state checks and does not authorize code or any configured/live durable store, payment/settlement, transaction verification, finality, evidence, result, API/UI, deployment, or external action.

No secrets, account keys, or private evidence belong in this file.
